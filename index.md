# Discourse anaphora and the dynamic notion of content

## Keeping track of marbles

(@) Andreea has **a partner**.  
**He** is standing next to her.

(@) Andreea is married.  
\# **He** is standing next to her.

(@) **Exactly one of the ten balls** is not in the bag.  
**It** is under the sofa. 
  
(@) Exactly nine of the ten balls are in the bag.  
\# **It** is under the sofa.

- (Heim 1982, Kamp 1988)

## Discourse anaphora and aboutness

- *Content* is influenced not just by *what* is said, but *how* it is said (Stalnaker 1998).

::: notes
Talk about Kamp, and Stalnaker's response to Kamp.

## Pragmatics

- The Stalnakerian perspective:

::: notes

sentences as arrows from worlds to truth-values; update an information state by filtering out the false-tagged worlds.

:::

## The dynamic perspective

::: notes

sentences as arrows from world-assignment pairs to sets of world assignment pairs; update an information state by gathering up the outputs.

## Conjunction

:::{.element: class="fragment"}
The dynamic connective *par excellence*: Referential information is piped from left-to-right, and flows outwards.
:::

(@) **A linguist** walked in, and **she** sat next to a philosopher.  
He yawned.

:::{.element: class="fragment"}
In the dynamic parlance, conjunction is *internally* and *externally dynamic*. (Groenendijk & Stokhof 1991; henceforth G&S)
:::

## Conditionals

:::{.element: class="fragment"}
Referential information is piped from left-to-right, but may flow no further.
:::

(@) If **a linguist**, **she**'s sitting next to a philosopher.  
\# He yawned.

:::{.element: class="fragment"}
Conditionals are *internally dynamic* but *externally static*.
:::

## Negation

:::{.element: class="fragment"}
Negation acts like a dam, blocking referential information from flowing further.
:::

- EXAMPLES

- Negation is *externally static*.

## Disjunction

:::{.element: class="fragment"}
There are no through-channels between disjuncts; referential information flows neither between disjuncts, nor beyond the disjunction.
:::

(@) Either a linguist is here, or she's smoking outside.

(@) Either a linguist is here, or the talk was badly advertised.  
\# She's smoking outside.

:::{.element: class="fragment"}
Disjunction is *internally* and *externally static*
:::

## Context change potentials

DS puts the lexicon in charge of regulating referential information flow.

::: {class="alert" name="The central dilemma"}
If logical connectives are responsible for regulating the flow of information, we make no substantial predictions about how the truth-conditional contribution of the connectives relates to referential information flow.
:::

(Schlenker 2006 a.o. make the same point wrt. presupposition projection.)

## An alternative take

To be developed today:

- Taking the accessibility generalizations to be indicative of the *semantic* contribution of the logical connectives *precludes* a principled account of referential information flow.
- The accessibility generalizations are empirically flawed; accessibility is sensitive to contextual factors.
- **The main point:** the logical connectives are exactly what they seem to be - *truth-functional operators* - referential information flows uniformly from left-to-right.

# Empirical issues for dynamic semantics

## Bathrooms

- Recall that, in DS, negation *destroys* referential information.
- But, referential information destroyed in an initial disjunct can be resurrected in a subsequent disjunct (observation due to Barbara Partee).

(@) Either there isn't **a bathroom**, or **it**'s upstairs.
