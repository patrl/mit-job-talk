## TODO

- We want a theory on which we can "flip a switch" and make predictions about *both* the incrementality of anaphora and presupposition projection (as emphasized by Chris). This is a theory that does this. We make a raft of interesting predictions, e.g., for acquisition and pathologies. 
- Can find nice background gifs via pi-slices.
